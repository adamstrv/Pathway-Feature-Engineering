def simulation(r1:float, r2:float):
    """
    Models a signaling pathway between macromolecular entities. Each element in the pathway contributes a signal of a given 
    strength to the next element, potentially leading to cell apoptosis. The downstream element (apoptosis)
    is only activated if the cumulative signal input exceeds a specific threshold. 
    Determines how every signal received by the receptors (beginning of the pathway) will determine the final 
    cellular apoptosis.  
    Input: external stimuli r1 and r2 (floats)
    Output: occurrence of apoptosis (boolean)
